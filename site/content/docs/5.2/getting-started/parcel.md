**Want to skip to the end?** Download the source code and working demo for this guide from the [twbs/examples repository](https://github.com/twbs/examples/tree/main/parcel). You can also [open the example in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/twbs/examples/tree/main/parcel?file=index.html), but Parcel isn't currently supported there.

## Setup

We're building a Parcel project with Bootstrap from scratch, so there are some prerequisites and up front steps before we can really get started. This guide requires you to have Node.js installed and some familiarity with the terminal.

<br>

1. **Create a project folder and setup npm.** We'll create the `my-project` folder and initialize npm with the `-y` argument to avoid it asking us all the interactive questions.

   ```sh
   mkdir my-project && cd my-project
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Parcel.** Next we need to install our Parcel development dependencies: .

   ```sh
   npm i --save-dev parcel
   ```

3. **Install Bootstrap.** Now we can install Bootstrap. We'll also install Popper since our dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips depend on it for their positioning. If you don't plan on using those components, you can omit Popper here.

   ```sh
   npm i --save bootstrap @popperjs/core
   ```

## Project structure

We've already created the `my-project` folder and initialized npm. Now we'll also create our `src` folder, stylesheet, and JavaScript file to round out the project structure.

1. **Create the project structure.** Run the following from `my-project`, or manually create the folder and file structure shown below.

   ```sh
   mkdir {src,src/js,src/scss}
   touch src/index.html src/js/main.js src/scss/styles.scss src/scss/_custom.scss
   ```

   When you're done, your complete project should look like this:

   ```text
   my-project/
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scss/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _custom.scss
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.scss
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
   â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
   â””â”€â”€ package.json
   ```

2. **Add the Parcel npm scripts.** Open the `package.json` and add the following `start` script to the `scripts` object. We'll use this script to start our Parcel development server and render the HTML file we created after it's compiled into the `dist` directory.

   ```json
   {
      // ...
      "scripts": {
        "start": "parcel serve src/index.html --public-url / --dist-dir dist",
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Fill in the `src/index.html` file.** Parcel needs a page to render, so we use our `index.html` page to setup some basic HTML, including our CSS and JavaScript files.

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
       <title>Bootstrap w/ Parcel</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="scss/styles.scss">
       <script type="module" src="js/main.js"></script>
     </head>
     <body>
       <div class="container py-4 px-3 mx-auto">
         <h1>Hello, Bootstrap and Parcel!</h1>
         <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary button</button>
       </div>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Parcel can automatically detect we're using Sass and install the [Sass Parcel plugin](https://parceljs.org/languages/sass/) to support it. However, if you wish, you can also manually run `npm i --save-dev @parcel/transformer-sass`.

4. **And finally, we can start Parcel.** From the `my-project` folder in your terminal, run that newly added npm script:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   <img class="img-fluid" src="/docs/{{< param docs_version >}}/assets/img/guides/parcel-dev-server.png" alt="Parcel dev server running">

At this point, everything is in the right place, but we don't have any styles or JavaScript from Bootstrap yet.

## Import Bootstrap

Importing Bootstrap into Parcel requires two imports, one into our `styles.scss` and one into our `main.js`.

1. **Import Bootstrap's CSS.** Add the following to `src/scss/styles.scss` to import all of Bootstrap's source Sass.

   ```scss
   @import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
   ```

   *You can also import our stylesheets individually if you want. [Read our Sass import docs]({{< docsref "/customize/sass#importing" >}}) for details.*

2. **Import Bootstrap's JS.** Add the following to `src/js/main.js` to import all of Bootstrap's JS. Popper will be imported automatically through Bootstrap.

   <!-- eslint-skip -->
   ```js
   import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap'
   ```

   You can also import JavaScript plugins individually as needed to keep bundle sizes down:

   ```js
   import Alert from 'bootstrap/js/dist/alert';

   // or, specify which plugins you need:
   import { Tooltip, Toast, Popover } from 'bootstrap';
   ```

   *[Read our JavaScript docs]({{< docsref "/getting-started/javascript/" >}}) for more information on how to use Bootstrap's plugins.*

3. **And you're done! ðŸŽ‰** With Bootstrap's source Sass and JS fully loaded, your local development server should now look like this.

   <img class="img-fluid" src="/docs/{{< param docs_version >}}/assets/img/guides/parcel-dev-server-bootstrap.png" alt="Parcel dev server running with Bootstrap">

   Now you can start adding any Bootstrap components you want to use. Be sure to [checkout the complete Parcel example project](https://github.com/twbs/examples/tree/main/parcel) for how to include additional custom Sass and optimize your build by importing only the parts of Bootstrap's CSS and JS that you need.
